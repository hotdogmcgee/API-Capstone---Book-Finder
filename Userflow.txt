USER FLOW

1. Distinct Views
    a. Opening page with explanation of app, has search field available.
    b. Recommendations given, user prompted to enter address/zip code to see if a local library has a copy.
    c. Copies of books available in local libraries.
    d. --maybe-- a page to show saved searches.

2. Three-part Flow
    a. User sees how to use app and search field.  This will be either the only thing to do or by far the largest thing. 
        After entering search with parameters, user will be shown results.
    b. User sees recommendations and prompted to enter address/zip code.  After entering, will be taken to "c".
    c. User sees a list of local copies, biased towards proximity (hopefully).  Can click through to those copies, or enter a new search term or address.
