An app that allows the user to find a book based on certain parameters.  The app will then allow a user to see if the book is available in the Harvard library system.

The original idea for the app was to use WorldCat's API to search for a specific library, but usage of the API is limited to institutions.  

Harvard's API works well enough, but the data structures are inconsistent. This had made the data a bit difficult to work with.
